## The Big Picture: How It Works

1. **Design & Content (Locally)**: You'll use a pre-built blog template (based on a Static Site Generator) to avoid designing from scratch. You will write your blog posts in simple text files using Markdown.
2. **Source Control (GitHub)**: You'll store all your blog's files (content, themes, configuration) in a repository on your GitHub account. This acts as the single source of truth for your blog.
3. **Build & Deploy (Netlify)**: You'll connect your GitHub repository to Netlify. Whenever you add a new post or make a change and push it to GitHub, Netlify will automatically "build" your blog (convert your Markdown files into a static HTML website) and publish it to its global network.
